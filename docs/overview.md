# Overview

`vocis` is a Linux X11 voice-to-text helper written in Go.

At a high level:

- a global hotkey starts dictation
- the overlay appears immediately with connection status
- local microphone capture starts first
- target-window capture happens after local recording has already started
- early audio is buffered while the OpenAI realtime transcription session connects (retries up to 3 times)
- buffered audio is flushed into the realtime session as soon as it is ready
- audio is streamed to OpenAI after that
- completed phrases accumulate in the overlay as you speak (one line per segment)
- on release or stop, the dictation session collects any trailing audio
- the text is optionally cleaned up by an LLM (post-processing via gpt-4o-mini)
- the accumulated text plus any trailing transcript is inserted back into the previously focused app as a single paste
- if submit mode was toggled on during recording, Enter is pressed after paste

Important constraints:

- Linux X11 only for now
- PulseAudio / PipeWire input capture
- OpenAI API key stored in the system keyring or provided by `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- overlay is intentionally lightweight and non-interactive (except Escape during finishing)

Core product choices:

- `hold` mode is the default hotkey behavior
- `toggle` mode is also supported by config
- very short recordings are silently discarded
- terminal windows use a terminal-safe paste shortcut
- transcription is realtime-streamed, not uploaded from a WAV file
- turn assembly and trailing-flush decisions live in the OpenAI dictation session, not in the app layer
- post-processing cleans up filler words and hesitations but never answers questions or changes intent
- config is reloaded on each recording start — no restart needed for most changes
- all overlay text is configurable via named templates in the config file
- audio ducking lowers speaker volume during recording to avoid mic feedback

## Modes

`vocis` has two dictation modes, run as separate subcommands:

- **`vocis serve`** — the push-to-talk default described above: hotkey
  starts/stops a dictation session, overlay is shown, transcript is
  pasted into the focused app.
- **`vocis recall`** (Wokis Recall) — always-on capture. The daemon
  (`vocis recall start`) continuously records the mic, segments speech
  with Silero VAD, and keeps a bounded ring buffer of recent utterances.
  `vocis recall pick` shows the recent segments in a terminal picker and
  transcribes the chosen one on demand. No live transcription happens
  until you pick — cheap when idle, slight latency on pick.

  Retention and ring-buffer size live under `recall:` in the config.

If you only need the "what is this thing" version of the repo, stop here.
